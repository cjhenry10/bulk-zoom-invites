# bulk-zoom-invites

This extension will help you respond to multiple Zoom meeting invites in your gmail inbox at one time.

_Important note: The invites need to be consecutive in your inbox. If you received an email that separates the bulk invites, you will need to run the extension again beginning with the Zoom invite closest to the top of your inbox._

1. Open the Zoom meeting invite email closest to the top of your inbox.
2. Set your attendance (Yes, No, Maybe) for every meeting using the dropdown menu.
3. Click the Start button to set your attendance.
